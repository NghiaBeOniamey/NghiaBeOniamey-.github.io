# What Is OOP (Object Oriented Programming)? Meaning, Concepts, and Benefits

_One of the more favored programming approaches, object-oriented programming (OOP), is built on objects, i.e., a set of
data and code._

## What is OOP (Object Oriented Programming)?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is defined as a programming paradigm (and not a specific language) built on the
concept of objects, i.e., a set of data contained in fields, and code, indicating procedures – instead of the usual
logic-based system.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach identifies classes of objects that are closely related to the methods with
which they are associated. It also covers the concepts of attribute and method inheritance. The Massachusetts Institute
of Technology was the first institution to utilize terminology referring to “objects” in the sense that we use
object-oriented programming today, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

It is a method for storing data and the operations required to process that data based on the mathematical field known
as abstract data types. Programming could advance to a more abstract level thanks to OOP. Nearly all developers employ
the core programming paradigm known as object-oriented programming at some point in their careers.

The well-known programming paradigm, OOP, is taught as the norm for most of a programmer’s educational career. OOP is
based on the idea of classes and objects. It organizes a computer program into basic, reusable blueprints of code or
“classes.” These classes are then used and reused to create new and unique objects with similar functions. This paradigm
represents a system that interacts with actual items in real life – such as the user.

Different parts of it perform actions on real-world items, creating actual interactions between people and machines. The
strategy is advantageous for collaborative development when projects are divided into groups due to the organization of
object-oriented software. Code reuse, scalability, and efficiency are other advantages of OOP.

The first stage in OOP is to gather all the objects that a programmer wishes to work with and determine their
relationships, a process known as data modeling. Data and functions are combined to create an object from the data
structure. Programmers can also establish connections between several objects. Objects can, for instance, acquire traits
from other objects. A human is a straightforward illustration of an object.

You would logically anticipate that a person would have a name. This would be regarded as being in the person’s
possession. Another thing you could expect from someone is their ability to do, like walk or drive. One might view this
as one of the person’s methods. Objects serve as the framework for object-oriented programming code.

Once your objects are in place, you may use their interactions to achieve the desired outcome. Consider the possibility
of a show where someone gets in a car and drives it from point A to point B. Beginning with the objects like a person or
a vehicle is how you would describe them.

The use of ways is one example of this: a person can drive a car, and a car can be driven. For the individual to drive,
you must gather your items so that they are all in one place. When the object is identified, it is assigned a class of
objects that describes the type of data it contains and sequences logic that could modify the data in any way. A method
is any particular logic sequence. With clearly specified interfaces known as messages, objects may communicate.

## Key Concepts of OOP

To understand and use object-oriented programming, it is necessary to know the following key concepts:

1. Class
   A class is the fundamental unit of C++ that paves the way for object-oriented programming. It is a user-defined data
   type that can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It has its own data members and member
   functions. A class is comparable to an object’s blueprint. Both member functions and data members are found in
   classes. The data members inside the class are manipulated using these member functions.

2. Object
   At the point of creation of a class, the description is the first object to be defined. An instance of a class exists
   in an object. Notably, the system does not allocate any memory space when a class is specified, but it’s allocated
   when it is instantiated, i.e., when an object is formed. Real-world things have state and behavior in common, a pair
   of features. An object conceals its behavior through methods and keeps its information in attributes.

3. Syntax
   The principles that specify how a language is structured are known as syntax. In programming languages (rather than
   natural languages like English), syntax is the set of rules that define and guide how words, punctuation, and symbols
   are organized in a programming language. Without syntax, it is almost difficult to comprehend the semantics or
   meaning of a language. A compiler or interpreter won’t be able to understand the code if the syntax of a language is
   not adhered to.

4. Encapsulation
   Encapsulation is the process of grouping functions and data into a single entity. To access these data members, the
   member function’s scope must be set to “public,” while the data members’ scope must be set to “private.” According to
   this theory, an item contains all important information; only a small subset is made available to the outside world.
   Each object has a private class that contains its implementation and state.

5. Polymorphism
   Multiple classes can use the same method name using polymorphism, which also involves redefining methods for derived
   classes. Compile-time polymorphism and run-time polymorphism are the two different types of polymorphism. In addition
   to having several forms, objects are made to have shared behaviors. To avoid writing duplicate code, the software
   will determine which usage or meaning is required for each time an object from a parent class is used.

6. Inheritance
   In its broadest sense, inheritance refers to the process of gaining properties. One object in OOP inherits the
   properties of another. Developers can reuse common functionality while retaining a distinct hierarchy by assigning
   relationships and subclasses between items. This characteristic of OOP speeds up development and provides more
   accuracy by requiring a more in-depth investigation of the data. The parent-child relationship is symbolized via
   inheritance.

7. Abstraction
   One of the OOP concepts in Java is abstraction, which is the act of representing key features without including
   supporting information. It is a method for developing a brand-new data type appropriate for a particular application.
   It avoids providing extraneous or pointless facts and only displays the precise portion the user has requested. It is
   crucial since it prevents you from performing the same task more than once.

8. Coupling
   Coupling describes the degree to which one software element is connected to another. Software elements can be a
   class, package, component, subsystem, or system. It denotes the level of familiarity one object or class has with
   another. This means that if one class changes its attributes, the dependent changes in the other will also change.
   The magnitude of interdependence between the two classes will determine how these changes occur.

9. Cohesion
   A class’s cohesion is determined by how closely and meaningfully coupled to one another its methods and properties
   are, as well as by how intently they are focused on carrying out a single, clearly defined goal for the system. This
   is a measure of how narrowly focused a class’s responsibilities are. Because their methods and properties don’t
   relate to one another logically, low cohesive classes are challenging to maintain.

10. Association
    An association is a relationship between two distinct classes that are established with the aid of their objects.
    One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many associations are all possible. An association is a connection
    between two things. The diversity between objects is defined by one of Java’s OOP concepts. There is no owner in
    this OOP concept, and each object has a distinct lifecycle.

11. Aggregation
    In this method, each object has a distinct lifecycle. Ownership, however, prevents the child object from being a
    part of another parent object. Java aggregation depicts the link between an object that contains other objects and
    is a weak association. This illustrates the connection between a component and a whole, where a part can exist
    without a whole. A unique type of semantically weak link called an aggregation occurs when unrelated things are
    combined.

12. Composition
    Composition is an association that depicts a relationship between a part and a whole in which a part cannot exist
    without a whole. Aggregation can take a variety of forms, including composition. Since child objects lack a
    lifecycle, they all automatically disappear when the parent object does. One object cannot exist without the other
    in any composition between two entities. As a result, both entities depend on one another in their composition.

13. Modularity
    Modular design refers to the division of a system into many functional pieces (referred to as modules) that can be
    combined to create a more extensive application. Modularity and encapsulation are inextricably related. When mapping
    encapsulated abstractions into actual, physical modules, high cohesion within the modules and limited inter-module
    interaction or coupling can be seen as the definition of modularity.

14. Constructors and methods
    A constructor is a specific kind of subroutine called to create an object. It sets up the new object for use and
    frequently accepts arguments from the constructor to set up necessary member variables. In OOP, a method is a
    procedure connected to a message and an object. An object’s state data and behavior make up its interface, which
    describes how any of its numerous consumers may use it. A method is a consumer-parameterized object activity.

## Advantages of OOP

Despite the rise of various programming models, OOP remains popular in DevOps. This is due to the following advantages
it provides:

1. Enables code reusability
   The idea of inheritance is one of the critical concepts offered by object-oriented programming. A class’s attributes
   can be passed down through inheritance, eliminating the need for duplication of effort. Doing this prevents the
   problems associated with repeatedly writing the same code.

Thanks to introducing the idea of classes, the code section can be used as many times as necessary in the program. A
child class that uses the inheritance method inherits the parent class’s fields and methods. One can readily alter the
parent class’s available methods and values.

2. Increases productivity in software development
   We can create programs from pre-written, interconnected modules rather than having to start from scratch, which would
   save time and increase productivity. Thanks to the OOP language, we can break the software into manageable, discrete
   problems. Because it allows for the division of labor in the creation of object-based programs, object-oriented
   programming is modular.

It is also extendable, as you may add new characteristics and actions to objects. One can utilize objects in several
applications. Object-oriented programming increases software development productivity, compared to conventional
procedure-based programming techniques, due to modularity, extensibility, and reusability.

3. Makes troubleshooting simpler
   When object-oriented programming is used, troubleshooting is made simpler since the user knows where to look in the
   code to find the source of the problem. Since the error will indicate where the issue is, there is no need to inspect
   additional code areas. All objects in object-oriented programming (OOP) are self-constrained, which is one benefit of
   employing encapsulation. [DevOps engineers](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/devops/articles/devops-engineer/) and
   developers gain a lot of advantages from this multimodal behavior
   because they may now work on several projects at once with the benefit of avoiding code duplication.

4. Reinforces security
   To
   maintain [application security](https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/application-security/articles/what-is-application-security-definition-best-practices/)
   and provide vital data for viewing, we are filtering out limited data through data hiding and abstraction mechanisms.
   The concept of data abstraction in OOPS allows only a small amount of data to be displayed to the user, which is one
   of OOP’s strong points.

When only the necessary info is accessible, the rest is not. As a result, it makes security maintenance possible.
Another set of OOP’s advantages in Java’s idea of abstraction is used to conceal complexity from other users and display
the element’s information per the requirements.

5. Simplifies code maintenance
   Object-oriented software is simpler to maintain in terms of code. Because of the design’s modularity, one can upgrade
   a portion of the system in the event of problems without calling for significant adjustments. Additionally, you can
   modify already-existing objects to create new ones.

Any programming language would benefit from having this capability; it prevents users from having to redo work in a
variety of ways. Maintaining and updating the current codes by adding new changes is always simple and time-saving.
Since one can produce new objects with just minor variations from old ones, it is simple to maintain and modify current
code.

6. Prevents the repetition of data
   Redundant data refers to data that has been duplicated. As a result, the same information is repeated. The redundancy
   of the data is seen as a benefit in object-oriented programming. For instance, the user would like the capability
   comparable to that of practically all classes.

In such circumstances, the user can construct classes with comparable functionality and inherit them when necessary. A
significant benefit of OOP is the redundancy of data. Users who want a comparable feature in numerous classes can write
standard class definitions for those features and inherit them.

7. Results in flexible code
   Polymorphism is the idea that allows for flexibility. The following advantages of polymorphism for developers are
   extensibility and simplicity. One advantage of OOP is polymorphism, which allows a piece of code to exist in more
   than one version. For instance, you might act differently if the setting or environment changes.

Let us look at a simple example. In a market, a person will act like a customer; in a school, a person will act like a
student; and in a home, a person will act like a son or daughter. Here, the same person exhibits various behaviors
depending on the environment.

8. Addresses issues early on
   Another benefit of object-oriented programming is that it may effectively solve problems by being divided into
   smaller components. It becomes good programming practice to deconstruct a complex issue into simpler parts or
   components. Given this information, OOPS uses a feature that divides the program code into smaller, more manageable
   chunks developed one at a time.

Once the issue has been disassembled, you can put the individual pieces to use again to address additional problems.
Additionally, *one might use the modules with the same interface and implementation details to replace the more minor
codes.

9. Provides design advantages
   A significant development in software engineering has been object-oriented development. Among other things, it
   promises to shorten development duration and give firms a competitive advantage. The design benefit that users will
   experience from OOPs is the ease with which they can design and fix things and the reduction of hazards, if any.

Here, object-oriented programs require a lengthy and thorough design phase from the designers, which produces better
designs with fewer faults. It is simpler to program all the non-OOPs independently after a certain point when the
program has hit some fundamental constraints.

10. Lowers development costs
    Using an object-oriented approach does make it possible to cut back on some of the direct costs involved with
    systems, including maintenance and development. Reusing software also reduces the price of development. In most
    cases, more time and effort are spent on object-oriented analysis and design, reducing the overall development cost.

The general cost of the improvement is reduced since more effort is typically put into the article-specific assessment
and plan. The development cost is generally reduced since more time and effort are usually spent on object-oriented
analysis and design.

## Takeaway

Object-oriented programming or OOP is a foundational concept for developers to understand, and several high-level
programming languages are built on OOP. The key OOP concepts can help you understand how basic programs work, [identify
the root cause](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/devops/articles/what-is-root-cause-analysis/) of bottlenecks, and
resolve them through more innovative code. As you learn new languages and use coding
suites, knowledge of OOP can prove instrumental to skill development.
